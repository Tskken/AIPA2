"""This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to control Pacman.

To select an agent, use the '-p' option when running pacman.py.

Arguments can be passed to your agent using '-a'.

Example:
    to load a SearchAgent that uses depth first search (dfs),
    run the following command:

    > python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a fn=depth_first_search

Commands to invoke other search strategies can be found in the project
description.

Please only change the parts of the file you are asked to.  Look for the lines
that say

# *** YOUR CODE HERE ***

The parts you fill in start about 3/4 of the way down.  Follow the assignment
description for details.

Good luck and happy searching!

    """Your heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem goes here.

    This heuristic must be consistent to ensure correctness.  First, try to
    come up with an admissible heuristic; almost all admissible heuristics will
    be consistent as well.

    If using A* ever finds a solution that is worse then uniform cost search
    finds, your heuristic is *not* consistent, and probably not admissible!
    On the other hand, inadmissible or inconsistent heuristics may find optimal
    solutions, so be careful.

    The state is a tuple (pacman_position, food_grid) where food_grid is a Grid
    (see game.py) of either True or False. You can call food_grid.as_list() to
    get a list of food coordinates instead.

    If you want access to info like walls, capsules, etc., you can query the
    problem.  For example, problem.walls gives you a Grid of where the walls
    are.

    If you want to *store* information to be reused in other calls to the
    heuristic, there is a dictionary called problem.heuristic_info that you can
    use. For example, if you only want to count the walls once and store that
    value, try: problem.heuristic_info['wall_count'] = problem.walls.count()
    Subsequent calls to this heuristic can access
    problem.heuristic_info['wall_count']
